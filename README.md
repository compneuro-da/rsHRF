### MATLAB 
The current GitHub repository contains the MATLAB code for rsHRF deconvolution and connectivity analysis, both for 1) the MATLAB Standalone as well as 2) the [SPM plugin](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ext/#rsHRF)
### Python
For information concerning 1) the Python Standalone, along with 2) the BIDS-App through Dockers/[brainlife](https://github.com/brainlife/app-rsHRF), head over to http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/rsHRF
   
## Getting Started
- <a href="https://github.com/compneuro-da/rsHRF/blob/master/Overview_Usage.md">Overview and Usage</a>
	- Step-by-step instructions for resting-state HRF analysis are available in the [rsHRF Matlab Manual](https://github.com/compneuro-da/rsHRF/raw/master/rsHRF_manual_Matlab.pdf).
