-------------

1. Simultaneous intrinsic optical signals (IOS) and local field potentials (LFP) recording from a Sprague-Dawley rat.
-------------
This data was recorded from a Sprague-Dawley rat(male) under 1.8-2% isoflurane anesthesia, which was detailed described in (Pan, Lee et al. 2018). We thank Wen-Ju Pan and Shella Keilholz for providing us with this data.

2. Resting-state fMRI dataset (UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics)
-------------
This dataset has been publicly released by the UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics (Poldrack, Congdon et al. 2016).
It has been pre-processed using the fMRIprep pipeline (Gorgolewski, Durnez et al. 2017), and can be accessed at https://www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds000030/.
