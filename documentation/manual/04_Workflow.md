# Preprocessing 
## Input:

<details><summary>What is the prefered input data format?</summary> <!-- FAQ -->
<br> <!-- insert image: batch: scans -->
<!-- <img align="right" src="https://github.com/compneuro-da/rsHRF/blob/update/img/input_01.png" alt="Input_Format" width="200"/> -->
<p align="justify">The <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> toolbox allows you to run the analyses on several formats of input data: <ul><li>3D NIfTI;</li> <li>4D NIfTI;</li> <li>extracted signals (.mat) â€“ [observation x voxels/vertices];</li> <li>2D surface-based (.gii) files.</li></p>
 
<!-- The input can be images (3D or 4D), mesh (2D), or directly matrices of [observation x voxels/vertices]. The demos allow you to run the analyses on several formats of input data. As shown in the Flowchart [insert] -->

</details>

<details><summary>Should the input data already be standardized (i.e. z-scored)?</summary> <!-- FAQ -->

<!-- to check; already included [?] -->

</details>

<details><summary>Should the input data already be denoised?</summary> <!-- FAQ -->

The input data consists of voxelwise/vertexwise BOLD signal, which you can already preprocesss according to your favorite recipe, which could include: <!-- cf. e-mail OHBM - what to add? -->
* nuisance variable regression 
* bandpass filter in the 0.01-0.08 Hz interval
* despiking

These denoising steps are also provided in the SPM plugin.
It is also possible to use a <code>temporal mask</code> to exclude some time points (for example after scrubbing).
<!-- temporal_mask: generated from scrubbing. -->

# Analysis:
<details><summary>Whole-brain or ROI analysis?</summary> <!-- FAQ -->

Both analyses are supported. However, outlier removal is only legit when conducting a whole-brain analysis.

## rsHRF retrieval and deconvolution

<!--
-- standalone: script demo 
-- SPM plugin:
SPM plugin
The script spm_rsHRF.m is the main one, and it calls rsHRF.m. These two files are specific to the SPM plugin. 
See [rsHRF_toolbox.pptx](https://github.com/guorongwu/rsHRF/raw/master/rsHRF_toolbox.pptx) for more details (Installation/Usage/Outputs).

## Connectivity analysis
The connectivity analysis (functional connectivity: Pearson/Spearman correlation, Pairwise/Conditional/Partially Conditioned Granger causality) is only provided in the rsHRF SPM plugin.
