# Overview 
 <img align="right" src="https://github.com/guorongwu/rsHRF/raw/master/docs/example_hrf.png" alt="BOLD_HRF" width="350"/> <!-- find other image to illustrate pseudo-point process + code to produce it -->
<p align="justify"><b>The basic idea.</b> According to the point process theory discrete <abbr title="Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent">BOLD</abbr> events (i.e. pseudo-events in the absence of an external stimulus) govern the brain dynamics at rest (e.g. Tagliazucchi et al. 2012). The <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> toolbox is aimed to retrieve the neuronal  onsets of these pseudo-events with no explicit stimulus and timing, along with the hemodynamic response (<abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr>) it set off. To this end, the <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> toolbox first identifies the pseudo-events, i.e. when the <i>standardized</i> resting-state <abbr title="Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent">BOLD</abbr> signal crosses a given threshold (1 SD; see Figure). Thereafter, a model is fitted to retrieve: <ol>
<li>the <i>optimal lag</i> between the pseudo-events and the neuronal (<abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr>) onset; </li>
 <li>the <i>shape of the estimated <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr></i> which will depend on the by-the-toolbox predefined <abbr title="hemodynamic response function">HRF</abbr> basis functions. Users of the <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> toolbox (<a href=""><b>v2.2</b></a>) can choose one of five options:</li><ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/compneuro-da/rsHRF/blob/master/wgr_rshrf_estimation_canonhrf2dd_par2.m"><code>wgr_rshrf_estimation_canonhrf2dd_par2.m</code></a>: a canonical HRF with its delay and dispersion derivatives ‚Äì <i>canon2dd</i>;</li>

# Usage 
<p align="justify">Once that the <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> has been retrieved for each voxel/vertex in the brain, you can:
 
<details><summary><i>use the <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> as a pathophysiological indicator</i> (by mapping the <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> shape onto the brain surface and looking at the inter-subject variability);<!--[[4](https://github.com/compneuro-da/rsHRF_data/raw/master/docs/2019_NI.pdf)]--></summary><br>

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/guorongwu/rsHRF/raw/master/docs/FIR_Height_full_layout.png" alt="HRF_map" width="350"/>
<p align="justify">The shape of the <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> can be characterized by <b>three parameters</b>, namely response height (<abbr title="response height"><i>RH</i></abbr>), time to peak (<abbr title="time to peak"><i>TTP</i></abbr>), and Full Width at Half Maximum (<abbr title="Full Width at Half Maximum"><i>FWHM</i></abbr>). Each of these parameters can be mapped onto the brain surface (see Figure for an example: full brain map of the response height estimated using the Finite Impulse Response basis functions). Note that the full brain map covers the full brain surface, including white matter and <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr>.

<!-- <p align="justify">The shape of the <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr>, and thus the time to peak (<abbr title="time to peak"><i>TTP</i></abbr>), differs for each voxel/vertex in the brain. As a result, two different voxels/vertices with pseudo-events at the same time might have disparate neuronal <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> onsets (for a schematic example, see Figure). Using non-deconvolved resting-state <abbr title="functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging">fMRI</abbr> <abbr title="Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent">BOLD</abbr> signal might therefore interpose confounders on temporal precedence, which can deteriorate lag-based connectivity estimates (e.g. functional connectivity). --> <!--As functional connectivity analysis is built on associating BOLD events on two different spatial locations but at the same time; eliminating these confounders is of essence [REF]. -->

<!--
