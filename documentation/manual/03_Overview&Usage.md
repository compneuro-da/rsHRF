<p align="justify"><b>The basic idea.</b> According to the point process theory discrete BOLD events (i.e. pseudo-events in the absence of an external stimulus) govern the brain dynamics at rest (e.g. Tagliazucchi et al. 2012). The <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> toolbox is aimed to retrieve the neuronal onsets of these pseudo-events with no explicit stimulus and timing for the <abbr title="hemodynamic response function">HRF</abbr> onset. To this end, the toolbox first identifies the pseudo-events, i.e. when the <i>standardized</i> resting-state BOLD signal crosses a given threshold (1 SD; see Figure 1). Thereafter, a model is fitted to retrieve: <ol>
<li>the <i>optimal lag</i> between the pseudo-events and the neuronal (<abbr title="hemodynamic response function">HRF</abbr>) onset; </li>
 <li>the <i>shape of the estimated <abbr title="hemodynamic response function">HRF</abbr></i> which will depend on the by-the-toolbox predefined <abbr title="hemodynamic response function">HRF</abbr> basis function. Users of the <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> toolbox (<a href=""><b>v2.2</b></a>) can choose one of five options:</li><br>

<p align="justify">In the Figure (for code see ...), NORMALIZED resting-state BOLD signal is illustrated; whenever the normalized signal exceeds a predefined treshold (i.e. SD = 1), that point in time is being marked as pseudo-event, indicated by SYMBOL. Therefafeter, the question remains how far the pseudo-event lags after the neuronal event.  A model WHICH ONE is used to retrieve the optimal lag between the events and the <abbr title="hemodynamic response function">HRF</abbr> onset, as well as the <abbr title="hemodynamic response function">HRF</abbr> shape. </p>

# Usage 
## Objectives
<p align="justify">HRF different for each voxel in the brain [REF] Then we can use it for two purposes:</p>

<p align="justify"><b>use shape as a biomarker</b>to retrieve the shape of the HRF concretized by three HRF parameters (see Figure 4); thee then use them in multivariate model; or look at some of them sepatetely
, or one can map the shape parameters everywhere in the brain (including white matter), and use the shape as a pathophysiological indicator [[4](https://github.com/compneuro-da/rsHRF_data/raw/master/docs/2019_NI.pdf)]. </p>

<!-- collapsible -->
<p align="justify"><b>eliminate time-lag confounds.</b> Once that the HRF has been retrieved for each voxel/vertex, it can be deconvolved from the time series (for example to improve lag-based connectivity estimates)
  to deconvolve the resting-state signal and ilimante timing confounds (as the HRF shape is different for each voxel in the brain, the time to peak is different as well; therefore even as two voxels would have a pseudo-event at the same time, the timing of the corresponding neuronal events might not coincide (see FIgure 3 as an example). As functional connectivity analysis is built on associating BOLD events on two different spatial locations but at the same time; elliminating such time confounds is of essence [REF].</p>


  the canonical shape with two derivatives, Gamma functions, Fourier set (Hanning), or a (smooth) Finite Impulse Response.
