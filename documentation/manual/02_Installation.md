# Dependencies
<p align="justify">To successfully run the MATLAB code for <i>rsHRF deconvolution and connectivity analysis</i>, <a href="https://nl.mathworks.com/help/install/"><b>MATLAB</b></a> and <a href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download/"><abbr title="Statistical Parametric Mapping"><b>SPM</b></abbr></a> should be installed. <abbr title="Statistical Parametric Mapping">SPM</abbr> is still necessary because the MATLAB code uses some of its basis functions (e.g. <code>spm_vol.m</code>, <code>spm_read_vols.m</code>...). After completing the installation, open MATLAB and add the <abbr title="Statistical Parametric Mapping">SPM</abbr> directory including all its folders and subfolders to the MATLAB search path:</p>
	
``` matlab
spmdir = '/full/path/to/spm12/';
addpath(genpath(spmdir));
 ```

# Setup
## Install the SPM toolbox
<p align="justify">After downloading the release version of your choice, you can either choose to use the scripts in the <code>rsHRF/code/</code> folder as a MATLAB Standalone or to install the <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> toolbox as an <abbr title="statistical parametric mapping">SPM</abbr> plugin.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>MATLAB Standalone.</b> The MATLAB Standalone is currently only available for voxel-wise <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> estimation and deconvolution as well as parameter retrieval (<abbr title="response height">RH</abbr>, <abbr title="time to peak">TTP</abbr>, and <abbr title="full width at half maximum">FWHM</abbr>). Demo scripts to use the functions in the <code>rsHRF/code/</code> folder can be found in the <code>rsHRF/documentation/demo/</code> folder. The demo scripts can easly be adapted into a function which you can use on your High Performance Computer. [<abbr title="Work In Progress"><i>WIP</i></abbr>] [EXAMPLE] </p>
	
<!-- The demo script can also be tranformed for usage on the cluster (see: XXX). However, for now, the connectivity scripts are not yet available as a standalone as they are incorporated in the SPM script.  use separet functions (for cluster usage); connectivity only available as part of SPM plugin  Follow the instructions. For more information, look at the ppt or watch the narrated video! -->

<p align="justify"><b><abbr title="statistical parametric mapping">SPM</abbr> plugin.</b> If you want to install the <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> toolbox as an <abbr title="statistical parametric mapping">SPM</abbr> plugin, extract the <i>rsHRF.zip</i> folder in your <code>Downloads</code> folder and move its contents into <code>./SPM/toolbox/rsHRF/</code>. To do so, open the downloaded <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function"><code>rsHRF</code></abbr> folder and run the <a href="https://github.com/compneuro-da/rsHRF/blob/master/rsHRF_install_SPM.m" title="rsHRF_install_SPM.m"><code>rsHRF_install_SPM.m</code></a> script in the MATLAB Command Window. All scripts within the downloaded <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function"><code>rsHRF</code></abbr> folder will be copied into a folder named <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function"><code>rsHRF</code></abbr> located in the <code>spm/toolbox/</code> folder.</p>  

## Open the rsHRF GUI

2. <p align="justify"> <b>Open the rsHRF GUI.</b> <br> There are two separate GUIs: one for <i>rsHRF retrieval and deconvolution</i> and one for <i>rsHRF connectivity analysis</i>. In order to open them, type respectively <code>rsHRF</code> and <code>rsHRF conn</code> in the MATLAB Command Window. You can also open them using the SPM GUI. To do so, go to the SPM folder and type spm fmri in the MATLAB Command Window. Once the SPM GUI has appeared, you go to the drop-down toolbox option under the display button where you select the rsHRF toolbox. By doing so, the rsHRF GUI will open.
