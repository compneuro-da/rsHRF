‚öôÔ∏è Installation
----

# Dependencies
<p align="justify">In order to successfully run the MATLAB code for <i>rsHRF deconvolution and connectivity analysis</i>, <a href="https://nl.mathworks.com/help/install/"><b>MATLAB</b></a> and <a href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download/"><abbr title="Statistical Parametric Mapping"><b>SPM</b></abbr></a> should be installed. <abbr title="Statistical Parametric Mapping">SPM</abbr> is still necessary because the MATLAB code uses some of its basis functions (e.g. <code>spm_vol.m</code>, <code>spm_read_vols.m</code>...). After completing the installation, open MATLAB and add the <abbr title="Statistical Parametric Mapping">SPM</abbr> directory to the MATLAB search path (<code>addpath.m</code>).</p>

# Download the release version of your choice
<p align="justify">Click on the corresponding üè∑ to download one of the release versions (i.e. <a href="#v1.0">v1.0</a>, <a href="#v2.0">v2.0</a>, and <a href="#v2.2">v2.2</a>) of the <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> <abbr title="statistical parametric mapping">SPM</abbr> plugin as a <i>.zip</i> folder in <code>Downloads</code>. For each release version, the main modifications are listed.

# Setup: install and open as an SPM toolbox

Ater downloading the release version of your choice, you can either use the scripts in ¬¥code¬¥ as a standalone, in combination with a demo script you will find in ¬¥documentation/demo¬¥ or as an SPM plugin with the GUI. The demo script can also be tranformed for usage on the cluster (see: XXX). However, for now, the connectivity scripts are not yet available as a standalone as they are incorporated in the SPM script. <!-- use separet functions (for cluster usage); connectivity only available as part of SPM plugin --> Follow the instructions. For more information, look at the ppt or watch the narrated video!

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/compneuro-da/rsHRF/blob/update/img/install_02.png" alt="Download" width="250"/>

1. <p align="justify"> <b>Extract the <i>.zip</i> folder and move it to <code>./SPM/toolbox/rsHRF</code>.</b> <br> After downloading a specific <abbr title="statistical parametric mapping">SPM</abbr> plugin <a title="release version">üè∑</a> as a <i>.zip</i> folder in <code>Downloads</code>, you first have to extract the <i>.zip</i> folder and move the extracted folder, along with its content to <code>./SPM/toolbox/rsHRF</code>. You can do this by running <a href="https://github.com/compneuro-da/rsHRF/blob/master/rsHRF_install_SPM.m" title="rsHRF_install_SPM.m"><code>rsHRF_install_SPM.m</code></a> in the Command Window opened within the <abbr title="resting-state hemodynamic response function">rsHRF</abbr> folder. 

2. <p align="justify"> <b>Open the rsHRF GUI.</b> <br> There are two separate GUIs: one for <i>rsHRF retrieval and deconvolution</i> and one for <i>rsHRF connectivity analysis</i>. In order to open them, type respectively <code>rsHRF</code> and <code>rsHRF conn</code> in the MATLAB Command Window. You can also open them using the SPM GUI. To do so, go to the SPM folder and type spm fmri in the Command Window. Once the SPM GUI has appeared, you go to the drop-down toolbox option under the display button where you select the rsHRF toolbox. By doing so, the rsHRF GUI will open.
